Using “pet” endpoints from https://petstore.swagger.io/ write CRUD operations API tests with
positive and negative scenarios.

It is requested to write test cases for above scenario.

I preferred spring-boot for easy to use, dependency injection, also it comes with many built-in test and util classes like spring-rest, junit, jupiter, etc.

there is application-local.yml and application-pipeline.yml files, which they inherited from application.yml. application-local.yml is git ignored and pipeline.yml file configs taken by github pipeline variables, you can check ci/cd pipeline variables here.
